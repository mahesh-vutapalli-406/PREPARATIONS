## Vault Topics

# ✅ HashiCorp Vault Topics for DevOps

## 📦 **1. Vault Basics (Foundation)**
- [ ] What is Vault? (Secrets Management & Zero Trust Security)
- [ ] Vault Architecture (Server, Storage Backend, Seal/Unseal Process)
- [ ] Installation & Setup (Dev Mode vs Production Mode)

## 🔑 **2. Core Concepts**
- [ ] Secrets Engines (Static & Dynamic Secrets)
- [ ] Authentication Methods (Token, AppRole, LDAP, GitHub, AWS IAM, etc.)
- [ ] Policies (Fine-Grained Access Control with HCL)
- [ ] Tokens (Root Tokens, Periodic Tokens, Orphan Tokens)

## 🔐 **3. Secrets Management**
- [ ] KV Secrets Engine (Key-Value Store v1 & v2)
- [ ] Dynamic Secrets (On-Demand Credential Generation)
- [ ] Leasing & Renewal (Managing TTLs, Secret Expiration)
- [ ] Revocation (Revoking Secrets & Tokens)

## 👥 **4. Authentication Methods (Detailed)**
- [ ] AppRole Authentication (For Machines & Automation)
- [ ] Userpass & LDAP Authentication (For Human Users)
- [ ] Cloud-Based Auth (AWS IAM, GCP, Azure)

## 🚀 **5. Advanced Vault Features**
- [ ] Transit Secrets Engine (Data Encryption/Decryption without Storage)
- [ ] PKI Secrets Engine (TLS/SSL Certificate Management)
