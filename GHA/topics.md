# ✅ GitHub Actions (GHA) Topics for DevOps

## 1. **Introduction to GitHub Actions**
- [ ] What is GitHub Actions? (CI/CD automation within GitHub repositories)
- [ ] Understanding workflows, jobs, and steps in GHA
- [ ] Key benefits of using GitHub Actions in DevOps pipelines

## 2. **Getting Started with GitHub Actions**
- [ ] Setting up GitHub Actions in a repository
- [ ] Understanding GitHub Actions syntax and structure
- [ ] Creating and managing GitHub workflows (`.github/workflows`)
- [ ] Using the GitHub Actions UI to trigger workflows

## 3. **GitHub Actions Workflow Basics**
- [ ] Creating a simple workflow (e.g., push events)
- [ ] Configuring events to trigger workflows (`push`, `pull_request`, `schedule`, etc.)
- [ ] Using YAML syntax to define jobs and steps
- [ ] Understanding job dependencies and job sequencing

## 4. **GitHub Actions Job & Step Concepts**
- [ ] Understanding jobs and how to configure them
- [ ] Creating steps to perform tasks like building, testing, and deploying
- [ ] Running steps in parallel vs sequentially
- [ ] Sharing data between jobs using artifacts and caching

## 5. **GitHub Actions Matrix Builds**
- [ ] Running tests in multiple environments with matrix builds
- [ ] Defining a matrix of different combinations (e.g., different OS, Node versions)
- [ ] Using matrix strategy to parallelize jobs for faster CI/CD pipelines

## 6. **GitHub Actions Secrets & Security**
- [ ] Using GitHub secrets to manage sensitive information (API keys, passwords)
- [ ] Best practices for managing and securing secrets in workflows
- [ ] Encrypting and decrypting data within workflows using secrets

## 7. **Using GitHub Actions Runners**
- [ ] GitHub-hosted runners vs self-hosted runners
- [ ] Configuring self-hosted runners for custom environments
- [ ] Understanding the different operating systems available for GitHub-hosted runners (Ubuntu, macOS, Windows)

## 8. **GitHub Actions Artifacts & Caching**
- [ ] Storing and retrieving build artifacts in workflows
- [ ] Using caching to improve build performance (e.g., caching dependencies)
- [ ] Setting up artifact and cache retention policies

## 9. **GitHub Actions Deployment & Automation**
- [ ] Automating deployments to cloud services (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud)
- [ ] Deploying to Kubernetes (using `kubectl` or Helm)
- [ ] Automating infrastructure provisioning using GitHub Actions and Terraform
- [ ] Continuous Deployment (CD) with GitHub Actions for app releases

## 10. **GitHub Actions for Testing**
- [ ] Setting up unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests in workflows
- [ ] Running tests on different environments or platforms using matrix builds
- [ ] Reporting test results using GitHub Actions integration (e.g., with Test Reports or GitHub Checks)

## 11. **Advanced GitHub Actions Concepts**
- [ ] Creating reusable workflows and actions (composing smaller workflows)
- [ ] Understanding and using GitHub Action templates
- [ ] Building and publishing custom GitHub Actions (creating your own reusable action)
- [ ] Working with GitHub Actions marketplaces (finding and using third-party actions)

## 12. **Monitoring and Debugging GitHub Actions**
- [ ] Viewing workflow logs and identifying failures
- [ ] Debugging GitHub Actions using `debug` mode and logs
- [ ] Using `workflow_run` to trigger workflows based on other workflows’ success/failure
- [ ] Setting up notifications and alerts for workflow runs (Slack, email, etc.)

## 13. **GitHub Actions for Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**
- [ ] Using GitHub Actions to run Terraform scripts for infrastructure provisioning
- [ ] Automating infrastructure testing with tools like `kitchen-terraform`
- [ ] Using GitHub Actions for managing Kubernetes deployments and updates
- [ ] Automating CloudFormation stacks deployment with GitHub Actions

## 14. **Best Practices and Optimization**
- [ ] Structuring workflows efficiently (reusable actions, splitting jobs)
- [ ] Optimizing build times using caching, dependencies, and matrix builds
- [ ] Using conditional execution (`if` statements) for better workflow control
- [ ] Managing complex workflows (caching, retries, and manual triggers)
