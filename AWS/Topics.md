# âœ… AWS Concepts for DevOps

- **CHEAT SHEET** - https://digitalcloud.training/aws-cheat-sheets/

## 1. **AWS Basics**
- [ ] Understand the core services, regions, and availability zones.
- [ ] Learn about AWS's global infrastructure (regions, availability zones, edge locations).
- [ ] Familiarize yourself with AWS Free Tier offerings for testing and learning.

## 2. **Compute Services**
- [ ] Launch, manage, and scale virtual machines (EC2 instances).
- [ ] Set up Auto Scaling for EC2 instances based on demand.
- [ ] Use Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) for distributing traffic across EC2 instances.
- [ ] Explore Lambda for serverless computing.
- [ ] Orchestrate Docker containers with ECS (Elastic Container Service).
- [ ] Manage Kubernetes clusters with EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service).

## 3. **Storage Services**
- [ ] Store files and backups using S3 (Simple Storage Service).
- [ ] Use EBS (Elastic Block Store) for block storage with EC2.
- [ ] Set up EFS (Elastic File System) for scalable file storage.
- [ ] Utilize Glacier for low-cost long-term storage.

## 4. **Networking Services**
- [ ] Create and manage Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs).
- [ ] Configure subnets and security groups for EC2 instances.
- [ ] Set up NACLs (Network Access Control Lists) for additional network security.
- [ ] Route traffic using Route 53 (DNS service).
- [ ] Accelerate content delivery using CloudFront (CDN).

## 5. **Database Services**
- [ ] Set up managed relational databases with RDS (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.).
- [ ] Use DynamoDB for NoSQL database needs.
- [ ] Implement Aurora for high availability and scalable relational databases.
- [ ] Analyze data using Redshift, a managed data warehouse.

## 6. **Security & Identity Services**
- [ ] Manage users and permissions with IAM (Identity and Access Management).
- [ ] Use AWS KMS (Key Management Service) for cryptographic key management.
- [ ] Track and log API calls using CloudTrail.
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerts with CloudWatch.
- [ ] Protect your applications with AWS Shield (DDoS protection).
- [ ] Manage user authentication with Cognito.

## 7. **DevOps & CI/CD Tools**
- [ ] Use CodeCommit for Git repository hosting.
- [ ] Automate CI/CD pipelines with CodePipeline.
- [ ] Build and test code with CodeBuild.
- [ ] Deploy applications with CodeDeploy.
- [ ] Deploy web apps with Elastic Beanstalk (PaaS).
- [ ] Automate infrastructure provisioning with CloudFormation (IaC).
- [ ] Manage configurations with OpsWorks (Chef and Puppet integration).
- [ ] Track logs with CloudWatch Logs.
- [ ] Use X-Ray for distributed application tracing.

## 8. **Container & Orchestration Services**
- [ ] Use ECS (Elastic Container Service) for container orchestration.
- [ ] Manage Kubernetes clusters with EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service).
- [ ] Run serverless containers with Fargate.

## 9. **Serverless Architecture**
- [ ] Use Lambda for serverless computing and event-driven code execution.
- [ ] Manage APIs with API Gateway (for serverless applications).
- [ ] Orchestrate serverless workflows with Step Functions.
- [ ] Build GraphQL APIs using AppSync.

## 10. **Monitoring & Logging**
- [ ] Set up monitoring, logging, and alerting with CloudWatch.
- [ ] Track detailed API logs with CloudTrail.
- [ ] Use X-Ray for tracing distributed applications.
- [ ] Monitor configuration changes with AWS Config.

## 11. **Automation & Orchestration**
- [ ] Automate infrastructure provisioning using CloudFormation.
- [ ] Use OpsWorks for automated configuration management.
- [ ] Automate EC2 instance management with AWS Systems Manager.
- [ ] Set up event-driven automation with Lambda and CloudWatch Events.

## 12. **Cost Management & Optimization**
- [ ] Analyze AWS costs with AWS Cost Explorer.
- [ ] Set up budgets and alerts with AWS Budgets.
- [ ] Get best practice recommendations for cost optimization with AWS Trusted Advisor.
