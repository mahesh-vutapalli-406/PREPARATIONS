**AWS Load Balancer Types -- Comparison & Use Cases**
====================================================

AWS provides different **Load Balancers (LBs)** under the **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) service**, which distributes incoming traffic across multiple targets (EC2, Lambda, containers, IPs, etc.) to improve application **availability, scalability, and fault tolerance**.

**1️⃣ AWS Load Balancer Types Overview**
----------------------------------------

| **Load Balancer** | **Best For** | **Protocol Support** | **Target Types** | **Cross-Zone Load Balancing** | **Cost** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** | HTTP(S) traffic, microservices, web apps | HTTP, HTTPS, WebSockets | EC2, Lambda, IPs, Containers (ECS, EKS, Fargate) | ✅ Yes | 💲💲 |
| **Network Load Balancer (NLB)** | TCP, UDP, high-performance, low-latency apps | TCP, UDP, TLS | EC2, IPs, Containers | ✅ Optional | 💲 |
| **Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB)** | Security appliances, firewall, packet inspection | IP Packet-based | VPC appliances (firewall, IDS/IPS) | ✅ Yes | 💲💲 |
| **Classic Load Balancer (CLB)** | Legacy apps (not recommended) | HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, SSL | EC2 only | ✅ Yes | 💲💲 |

* * * * *

**2️⃣ Key Features & Differences**
----------------------------------

| **Feature** | **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** | **Network Load Balancer (NLB)** | **Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB)** | **Classic Load Balancer (CLB)** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Layer** | Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS) | Layer 4 (TCP/UDP) | Layer 3 (IP packets) | Layer 4 & Layer 7 |
| **Use Case** | Web apps, API Gateway, microservices | Low-latency, high-throughput apps | Security appliances | Legacy apps |
| **SSL Termination** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| **WebSockets Support** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| **Cross-Zone Load Balancing** | ✅ Yes (default) | ✅ Optional | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| **Health Checks** | HTTP(S) | TCP/HTTPS | TCP | HTTP/TCP |
| **Target Groups** | EC2, Lambda, IPs, Containers | EC2, IPs, Containers | Virtual Appliances | EC2 |

* * * * *

**3️⃣ When to Use Each Load Balancer?**
---------------------------------------

| **Use Case** | **Best Load Balancer** |
| --- | --- |
| **Web applications, microservices, API Gateway** | ✅ **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** |
| **Gaming, IoT, financial transactions, low-latency workloads** | ✅ **Network Load Balancer (NLB)** |
| **Security appliances (firewalls, intrusion detection systems, IDS/IPS)** | ✅ **Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB)** |
| **Legacy applications requiring Layer 4 & Layer 7 balancing** | ✅ **Classic Load Balancer (CLB)** (not recommended) |

* * * * *

**4️⃣ Load Balancer Pricing**
-----------------------------

| **Load Balancer** | **Cost Calculation** | **Cost Range** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **ALB** | Per hour + LCU (Load Capacity Units) | 💲💲 |
| **NLB** | Per hour + LCU | 💲 |
| **GWLB** | Per hour + processed traffic | 💲💲 |
| **CLB** | Per hour + traffic | 💲💲 |

✅ **ALB is the most expensive** due to its Layer 7 features.\
✅ **NLB is cheaper** and best for **low-latency, high-throughput applications**.\
✅ **GWLB pricing is based on the amount of data processed**, making it costlier for **high traffic**.\
✅ **CLB is outdated** and **more expensive** compared to ALB and NLB for most use cases.

* * * * *

**5️⃣ Security Best Practices for AWS Load Balancers**
------------------------------------------------------

### **🔐 Authentication & Security**

✅ **Use AWS WAF with ALB** → Protect against SQL injection, XSS, and DDoS attacks.\
✅ **Enable SSL/TLS Termination** → Offload encryption for better performance.\
✅ **Restrict Traffic Using Security Groups** → Only allow necessary inbound and outbound connections.

### **🛡️ DDoS & High Availability Protection**

✅ **Use AWS Shield with ALB & NLB** → Protect against DDoS attacks.\
✅ **Enable Cross-Zone Load Balancing** → Distribute traffic evenly across all AZs.

### **🔍 Logging & Monitoring**

✅ **Enable ELB Logs** → Track access and traffic patterns using CloudWatch.\
✅ **Set Up AWS CloudTrail** → Monitor API calls and security events.

* * * * *

**6️⃣ AWS Load Balancer vs. API Gateway**
-----------------------------------------

| **Feature** | **ALB (Application Load Balancer)** | **API Gateway** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Best For** | Web apps, microservices | Serverless APIs, Lambda, HTTP Proxy |
| **Protocol** | HTTP, HTTPS | HTTP, WebSocket, REST, GraphQL |
| **Integration** | EC2, ECS, Lambda | Lambda, DynamoDB, S3, Step Functions |
| **Authentication** | IAM, Cognito, OAuth 2.0 | IAM, API Keys, JWT |
| **Cost** | Higher (based on LCUs) | Lower (per request) |

✅ **Use ALB** → If you need **load balancing for EC2, ECS, or Lambda**.\
✅ **Use API Gateway** → If you need **fully managed API handling with authentication & caching**.

* * * * *

**7️⃣ Final Thoughts -- Best Practices for Load Balancers**
----------------------------------------------------------

🚀 **Use ALB** for **HTTP-based applications & microservices**.\
🚀 **Use NLB** for **low-latency TCP/UDP applications**.\
🚀 **Use GWLB** for **security appliances (firewalls, IDS/IPS, packet inspection)**.\
🚀 **Use Auto Scaling with Load Balancers** to **improve fault tolerance**.\
🚀 **Enable AWS WAF with ALB** for **better security**.\
🚀 **Use CloudFront + ALB** for **global content caching & DDoS protection**.

##### You said:

gateway loadbalancer is for internal VPC loadbalancer ?

###### ChatGPT said:

Yes, **AWS Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB)** is specifically designed for **internal VPC traffic** and is primarily used to **deploy, scale, and manage third-party virtual appliances**, such as **firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), intrusion prevention systems (IPS), and deep packet inspection (DPI) tools**.

* * * * *

**🔹 Key Features of Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB)**
---------------------------------------------------

✅ **Layer 3 (IP Packet-Based) Load Balancing** → Routes traffic at the IP packet level.\
✅ **Transparent Inspection** → Sends traffic through security appliances **without needing manual route changes**.\
✅ **VPC-to-VPC & Inter-Region Traffic Inspection** → Enables **centralized security** for multiple VPCs.\
✅ **Auto Scaling for Security Appliances** → Works with AWS Auto Scaling groups.\
✅ **Integrated with AWS Transit Gateway** → Enables security at scale across multiple VPCs.\
✅ **Cross-Zone Load Balancing Enabled by Default** → Ensures high availability across AZs.

* * * * *

**🔹 When to Use AWS Gateway Load Balancer?**
---------------------------------------------

| **Use Case** | **Best Practice** |
| --- | --- |
| **Deploying Firewalls (CheckPoint, Palo Alto, FortiGate, etc.)** | Use GWLB to distribute traffic across multiple firewall instances. |
| **Deep Packet Inspection (DPI)** | Route traffic through network security appliances. |
| **VPC-to-VPC Security Traffic Filtering** | Use GWLB + AWS Transit Gateway for centralized inspection. |
| **Multi-Region Security Enforcement** | Deploy GWLB in multiple regions for **global traffic security**. |

✅ **Use GWLB** if you need **internal VPC security, network appliance auto-scaling, or centralized security traffic filtering**.\
❌ **Do NOT use GWLB** for **public-facing applications** (use ALB/NLB instead).
